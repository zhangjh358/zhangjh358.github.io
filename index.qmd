::: {#hero-heading}

Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate at the International School of Business & Finance, Sun Yat-sen University, supervised by Prof. Caiping Wang. I will be a visiting Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University (Nanyang Business School) in Singapore from August 2025 to August 2026, under the supervision of Asst. Prof. Zeng Yachang. Before this, I earned my bachelor's degree from Dongbei University of Finance and Economics.

My current research interests primarily include:

- State-Owned Capital

- Mergers & Acquisitions

- Technological Innovation

- Securities Regulation

I have published three academic papers in 《金融研究》 (Journal of Financial Research), 《管理学报》 (Chinese Journal of Management), and 《科技进步与对策》 (Science & Technology Progress and Policy). I was awarded the National Scholarship for Graduate Students in 2024 and have received the President’s Scholarship of Sun Yat-sen University multiple times.

I was born and raised in Fushun, Liaoning Province, a city known for its rich industrial heritage. As an INTJ personality type, I am analytical, independent, and future-focused. Outside of academia, I enjoy playing basketball, singing, and watching movies. I also have a very well-behaved and lovely cat named Xiaohua, who is a constant source of comfort and joy in my life.
